# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Description
A restaurant application that allows users to log the names of burgers they would like to eat and track burgers they have already devoured. 

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the application will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be moved to the right side of the page with all the "devoured" burgers.

Added the wrong burger or pressed the devour button prematurely? Users are able to delete any burger from either list or revert a devoured burger back to the waiting area. 

This application is deployed with Heroku using the Jaws database. This burger logger stores all burgers in the burger database, whether devoured or not!
