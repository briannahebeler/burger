# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Description (update)
- Burger Logger
- Restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page
- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not

## Instructions (delete after)
